# Pomodor_Timer

The Pomodoro Timer is used to help people focus for a certain period of time, then take a break.
With this application you can adjust the time you would like to focus, and the time you would like to have a break.
Once you start the timer a progress bar will be active and an alert will sound when the session is over.
